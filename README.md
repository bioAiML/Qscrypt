# Technical White Paper: Qscrypt - Scalable Scrypt Mining for Litecoin and Dogecoin

## Abstract
Qscrypt is a high-performance, scalable Scrypt mining software designed to leverage the computational power of up to 600,000 Qubic network miners to dominate Litecoin (~1 TH/s network hashrate) and Dogecoin (~1.5 TH/s network hashrate) block rewards. By integrating multi-pool failover, Apache Kafka for nonce coordination, and support for ASICs, GPUs, and CPUs, Qscrypt ensures zero downtime, eliminates nonce collisions, and maximizes profitability. Fully interoperable with the Qubic network (https://github.com/qubic-li/client), it operates on self-hosted infrastructure, avoiding reliance on external cloud providers. With a total hashrate of ~150,150 TH/s, Qscrypt achieves ~99% block share, generating significant daily revenue (~$860K for Litecoin, ~$5.1M for Dogecoin) while maintaining security and scalability.

## 1. Introduction
Qscrypt is a purpose-built Python software that enables hundreds of thousands of Qubic miners to mine Litecoin and Dogecoin using the Scrypt algorithm. By combining robust failover mechanisms, distributed task coordination, and advanced hardware support, Qscrypt offers a scalable, secure, and efficient solution for large-scale mining operations

This white paper details the technical architecture, key features, performance metrics, and investment potential for stakeholders seeking to capitalize on the Qubic network’s computational capacity.

## 2. Technical Architecture

Qscrypt is designed for distributed mining at scale, with a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly with the Qubic network’s idling phases. Its core components include:

- Stratum Client: Connects to multiple Stratum mining pools (e.g., `litecoinpool.org`, `f2pool.com`, `viabtc.com`) with automatic failover to eliminate downtime.
  
- Kafka Coordination: A self-hosted Apache Kafka cluster distributes mining tasks and aggregates shares, ensuring nonce collision elimination and rate limit management.
  
- Scrypt Hashing:
  - **ASICs**: Supports Scrypt ASICs (e.g., Bitmain L3++, ~500 MH/s) via CGMiner drivers.
  - **GPUs**: Uses an OpenCL Scrypt kernel (`N=1024`, `r=1`, `p=1`) for NVIDIA/AMD GPUs (~500 KH/s per RTX 4090).
  - **CPUs**: Employs Python `scrypt` library (~50 KH/s per Ryzen 9 core).
    
- **Profitability Switching**: Queries CoinGecko API to dynamically select Litecoin or Dogecoin based on USD value.
  
- **Monitoring**: Exports hashrate and share metrics to Prometheus (`http://localhost:8000`) for real-time performance tracking.

The system operates in two modes:

- **Coordinator Mode**: A central node fetches jobs from Stratum pools, assigns nonce ranges via Kafka, and submits shares.
  
- **Miner Mode**: Individual miners consume tasks from Kafka, perform Scrypt hashing, and submit shares, integrated with Qubic’s idling phase.

## 3. Key Features
## 3.1 Multi-Pool Failover
Qscrypt connects to multiple Stratum pools, automatically switching to backup pools on failure (e.g., network issues, pool downtime). Retries occur every 30 seconds, ensuring near-zero downtime and continuous mining.

## 3.2 Kafka-Based Coordination
A self-hosted Kafka cluster assigns unique nonce ranges to eliminate collisions. It throttles share submissions (~1 share/s/miner to prevent pool rate limits, ensuring stable operation.

## 3.3 Hardware Support
Qscrypt supports diverse hardware:
- **ASICs**: Bitmain L3++ (~500 MH/s, 800W) for high efficiency.
- **GPUs**: OpenCL kernel for NVIDIA/AMD GPUs (~500 KH/s, 450W).
- **CPUs**: Python-based Scrypt for commodity hardware (~50 KH/s, 120W).
Dynamic hardware detection and optimization adjust parameters (e.g., thread concurrency, intensity) based on available resources.

## 3.4 Qubic Network Integration
Qscrypt integrates with the Qubic network (https://github.com/qubic-li/client) by running during idling phases, configured via Qubic’s `appsettings.json`. This allows Qubic miners to perform Scrypt hashing without disrupting AI training tasks, leveraging existing CPU/GPU resources.

## 3.5 Security
- **Encryption**: SSL for Kafka (`security_protocol="SSL"`) and Stratum (`TlsEnabled: true`) ensures secure task/share transmission.
- 
- **Authentication**: Unique `MinerId` per miner enables coordinator validation.
- 
- **Self-Hosted Infrastructure**: Eliminates reliance on cloud providers (e.g., AWS MSK), reducing third-party risks.

## 3.6 Scalability

Designed for hundreds of thousands of miners, Qscrypt scales via:
- Kafka’s partitioning (600 partitions, 3x replication) for ~600,000 miners or messages/s.
- Multiple coordinators (3–5) to distribute load.
- Multi-pool failover to bypass single-pool connection limits (~10,000–50,000).

## 3.7 Monitoring and Optimization
Prometheus metrics track hashrate, shares, and errors, with logs (`miner.log`) for debugging. Dynamic tuning adjusts CPU threads, GPU intensity, and thread concurrency based on system load and memory.

- **Downtime**: Near-zero with multi-pool failover.

- **Market Resilience**: Dynamic network switching (Litecoin/Dogecoin) mitigates price volatility, ensuring consistent profitability.

## 6. Deployment Considerations
- **Kafka Cluster**: Deploy 10–15 brokers (4–8 cores, 16–32GB RAM, 1–2TB SSD) with 3 Zookeeper nodes.
- 
- **Qubic Integration**: Configure Qubic clients to run `Qscrypt.py` during idling phases. Test with 10–100 miners to ensure compatibility.
  
- **Monitoring**: Use Prometheus/Grafana for centralized metrics, ensuring operational transparency.
